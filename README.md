- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rntrm!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS, HTML and JavaScript whilst trying to figure out Linux and how to get my custom keyboard layout working there :D
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make life easier, or just some visually enticing projects and games.
- 📫 You can reach me by sending out an e-mail to tormi.vahar@gmail.com ;)
